# About
This is a Javascript/jQuery/HTML/CSS implementation of "Conway's Game of Life." Conway's game is a mathematical simulation; think of it as a sort of "Sim Bacteria" where cells live or die based on [certain rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

There is a live version at http://www.squidproco.com/game-of-life/
